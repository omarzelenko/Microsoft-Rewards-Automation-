# Bing Search Automation Application (EXE Version)
This is a standalone executable (EXE) Bing Search Automation tool that automates performing searches on Bing using a list of search terms provided in a `.txt` file. The program does not require any additional installations or dependencies, as it comes packaged as a self-contained EXE file.

## Features
- Automates searches on Bing using a list of search terms.
- Option to run the tool in headless mode (no GUI).
- Configurable search delay between queries.
- Saves logs of the search operations for debugging and tracking.
- Configurable timeout settings and retry logic for searches.
- Open-source and free to use, with modifications under the conditions in the LICENSE.txt.

## Requirements

4. Create or prepare your search terms file (`search.txt`), with each search term on a new line.
